```

### Error Output (Exit Code > 0)

**stdout (not stderr - friendly errors go to stdout):**
```
Oops! I ran into a problem setting up ResearchKit. ðŸ˜•

What happened:
  I couldn't create a folder in your home directory.

Why this happened:
  The folder might be read-only, or your disk might be full.

How to fix it:
  1. Check if you have space on your computer:
     â€¢ Open Finder â†’ About This Mac â†’ Storage
     â€¢ You need at least 10 MB free

  2. If you have space, try installing to a different folder:
     â€¢ Run: ./install.sh ~/Documents/.researchkit

## Side Effects

### File System Changes

**Created Directories:**
- `$TARGET_DIR/` - Installation root
- `$TARGET_DIR/installer/` - Installer scripts
- `$TARGET_DIR/templates/` - Research templates
- `$TARGET_DIR/commands/` - Command definitions
- `$TARGET_DIR/docs/` - Documentation
- `$HOME/.claude/commands/` - Claude Code commands (if doesn't exist)

**Created Files:**
- `$TARGET_DIR/.researchkit_version` - Version identifier
- `$TARGET_DIR/.install_manifest` - File checksums
- `$TARGET_DIR/.install_metadata` - Install metadata (JSON)
- `$TARGET_DIR/config.yaml` - Configuration file
- `$TARGET_DIR/templates/*.md` - Template files (6):
  - CLAUDE-template.md
  - constitution-template.md
  - framework-template.md
  - question-template.md
  - research-path-template.md
  - story-template.md
- `$TARGET_DIR/commands/*.md` - Command source files (13):
  - rk-capture-story.md
  - rk-collect-documents.md
  - rk-constitution.md
  - rk-create-stream.md
  - rk-cross-stream.md
  - rk-find-stories.md
  - rk-frameworks.md
  - rk-identify-paths.md
  - rk-init.md
  - rk-question.md
  - rk-research.md
  - rk-validate.md
  - rk-write.md
- `$TARGET_DIR/docs/*.md` - Documentation files (getting-started.md)
- `$HOME/.claude/commands/rk-*.md` - Copied commands (13)

**Modified Files:**
- Shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.bash_profile`) - Adds PATH entry (if not present)

### System State Changes

- ResearchKit commands become available in Claude Code
- `$TARGET_DIR/bin/` added to user's PATH (after shell restart)
- Installation metadata recorded for future updates

---

## Pre-conditions

**Required:**
- User has read/write permissions in target directory parent
- Shell environment is bash 4.0+ compatible
- Standard POSIX utilities available (mkdir, cp, mv, cat, grep)

**Optional:**
- Git available (for version information)
- Claude Code installed (for command integration)
- Internet connection (for version checking - future enhancement)

---

## Post-conditions

**On Success:**
- All files installed to `$TARGET_DIR`
- Commands copied to `.claude/commands/`
- Shell profile updated with PATH entry
- Validation report shows all checks passing
- Exit code 0

**On Failure:**
- No partial installation (rolled back if possible)
- Clear error message describing problem
- Non-zero exit code indicating error type
- Original state preserved (for update scenarios)

---

## Error Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Permission Denied

**Input:** `./install.sh /read-only-dir`

**Expected Behavior:**
- Detects write permission issue immediately
- Outputs clear error message to stderr
- Exits with code 2
- No files created

**Error Message:**
```
Error: Cannot write to /read-only-dir
Permission denied when creating installation directory.

Try:
  - Choose a different installation directory
  - Run with appropriate permissions
  - Use default location: ./install.sh (installs to ~/.researchkit)
```

### Scenario 2: Existing Installation (Interactive)

**Input:** `./install.sh` (when ResearchKit already installed)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Detects existing installation
- Prompts user for action
- Waits for user input
- Executes chosen action (update/skip/abort)

**Prompt:**
```
==> Existing ResearchKit installation detected
  Location: /home/user/.researchkit
  Version: 1.0.0

Options:
  [U] Update existing installation
  [S] Skip (keep current installation)
  [A] Abort installation

Choice [U/S/A]:
```

### Scenario 3: Missing Claude Code

**Input:** `./install.sh`

**Expected Behavior:**
- Installation proceeds normally
- Warns about missing `.claude/commands/` directory
- Creates commands in ResearchKit directory
- Exits with code 0 (warning, not error)

**Warning Message:**
```
Warning: Claude Code commands directory not found
  Expected: /home/user/.claude/commands/

ResearchKit commands were installed to:
  /home/user/.researchkit/commands/

To enable commands in Claude Code:
  1. Ensure Claude Code is installed
  2. Create commands directory: mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
  3. Copy commands: cp ~/.researchkit/commands/rk-*.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

---

## Idempotency Guarantee

Running `./install.sh` multiple times with the same arguments must:
- Produce the same result
- Not cause errors or corruption
- Preserve user customizations (in update mode)
- Exit successfully with code 0

**Safe Operations:**
- `mkdir -p` - Creates only if doesn't exist
- `ln -sfn` - Symlinks force-update safely
- `grep -qF` before append - Prevents duplicate profile entries
- Backup before overwrite - Preserves original state

---

## Performance Expectations

| Operation | Expected Time | Max Acceptable Time |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Fresh install | < 5 seconds | < 10 seconds |
| Update install | < 3 seconds | < 10 seconds |
| Directory creation | < 1 second | < 2 seconds |
| File copying | < 2 seconds | < 5 seconds |
| Profile modification | < 1 second | < 2 seconds |

**Note:** Times assume local file operations. Network operations (future versions) may be slower.

## Examples

### Example 1: Fresh Install (Default Location)

```bash
$ ./install.sh

âœ“ Installation complete!
$ echo $?
0
```

### Example 2: Install to Custom Directory

```bash
$ ./install.sh ~/projects/research/.researchkit

âœ“ Installation complete!
```

### Example 3: Force Reinstall (Non-Interactive)

```bash
$ ./install.sh --force --noninteractive
==> ResearchKit Installer
==> Existing installation detected
==> Force mode enabled - overwriting
âœ“ Installation complete!
```

### Example 4: Install Specific Version

```bash
$ ./install.sh --version 1.2.0
==> ResearchKit Installer
==> Installing ResearchKit version 1.2.0
âœ“ Installation complete!
```

### Example 5: Install Without Claude Code Commands

```bash
$ ./install.sh --no-commands
==> ResearchKit Installer
==> Skipping Claude Code command installation
âœ“ Installation complete!
```
