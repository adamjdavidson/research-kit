**stdout:**
```
Great news! I found some updates for ResearchKit. üî¨

I'll update ResearchKit for you - this will only take a moment.
Your research files are safe and won't be touched.

I see you're on version 1.0.0, and I'll update you to 1.1.0.

First, I'll make a backup of everything (just to be safe)...
‚úì Backup created - your current setup is saved

Updating your ResearchKit...
‚úì Updated 3 templates (2 kept because you customized them)
‚úì Updated 13 commands with new features
‚úì Updated installer tools
‚úì Everything synced with Claude Code

All done! üéâ

What changed:
  ‚Ä¢ 3 templates got new features
  ‚Ä¢ 2 templates kept your customizations (narrative-outline.md, analysis-template.md)
  ‚Ä¢ 13 commands updated with improvements

Your backup is here if you need it:
  ~/.researchkit.backup.20251025_143000

You're all set - happy researching!
```

**stdout:**
```
Checking for ResearchKit updates... üîç

Good news - you're already on the latest version! ‚úì

Your ResearchKit is up to date (version 1.1.0).
No updates needed right now.

Keep researching! üéâ
```

### Error Output (Exit Code > 0)

**stdout (not stderr - friendly errors go to stdout):**
```
Hmm, I couldn't find ResearchKit on your computer. üòï

What happened:
  I looked for ResearchKit at ~/.researchkit but it's not there yet.

Why this happened:
  ResearchKit hasn't been installed on this computer yet, or it was
  installed somewhere else.

How to fix it:
  1. Install ResearchKit first by running:
     ./install.sh

  2. Or, if you installed it somewhere else, tell me where:
     ./update.sh /path/to/your/.researchkit

  ~/.researchkit/docs/getting-started.md

## Side Effects

### File System Changes (Successful Update)

**Backed Up:**
- Entire `$INSTALL_DIR/` directory copied to timestamped backup

**Modified Files (System Files Only):**
- `$INSTALL_DIR/installer/*.sh` - Installer scripts updated
- `$INSTALL_DIR/commands/*.md` - Command definitions updated (if changed)
- `$INSTALL_DIR/docs/*.md` - Documentation updated
- `$HOME/.claude/commands/rk-*.md` - Commands recopied

**Preserved Files (User Customizations):**
- `$INSTALL_DIR/config.yaml` - User configuration preserved
- `$INSTALL_DIR/templates/*.md` - User-modified templates preserved
- Any files in `$INSTALL_DIR/` not part of base installation

**Updated Metadata:**
- `$INSTALL_DIR/.researchkit_version` - Version number updated
- `$INSTALL_DIR/.install_metadata` - `last_updated` timestamp updated
- `$INSTALL_DIR/.install_manifest` - File checksums updated

---

## Pre-conditions

**Required:**
- Existing ResearchKit installation at `$INSTALL_DIR`
- User has read/write permissions on installation directory
- Sufficient disk space for backup (typically < 1MB)

**Optional:**
- Network connection (for fetching updates - future enhancement)
- Git available (for version control operations)

---

## Post-conditions

### On Success

- Installation updated to target version
- Backup created at `$INSTALL_DIR.backup.<timestamp>`
- User customizations preserved
- Commands synced to Claude Code
- Exit code 0

### On Failure

- Original installation unchanged (rollback if partial failure)
- Error message explaining issue
- Non-zero exit code
- Backup preserved (if created before failure)

---

## Update Strategy

### File Categories

**1. System Files (Always Updated):**
- `installer/*.sh` - Installer scripts
- `commands/*.md` - Command definitions
- `docs/*.md` - Documentation
- Metadata files (`.researchkit_version`, `.install_manifest`)

**2. User Configuration (Preserved):**
- `config.yaml` - User settings
- User-modified templates (detected via checksum comparison)

**3. New Files (Added):**
- Any new templates, commands, or documentation in target version

### Conflict Resolution

**Customized Templates:**
1. Compare current file checksum with manifest
2. If modified by user ‚Üí preserve current version, show warning
3. If unmodified ‚Üí update to new version
4. Original new version available in backup if user wants to merge

**Conflicting Updates:**
- If update would overwrite user changes to system files ‚Üí prompt user
- Options: Keep current, Use new version, Show diff, Abort update

## Error Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Installation Not Found

**Input:** `./update.sh /nonexistent/path`

**Expected Behavior:**
- Detects missing installation
- Outputs clear error message
- Exits with code 2

**Error Message:**
```
Error: Installation not found at /nonexistent/path

Cannot update: no existing installation detected.

To install ResearchKit:
  ./install.sh /nonexistent/path
```

### Scenario 2: Backup Failed

**Input:** `./update.sh` (when disk full or permissions issue)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Attempts to create backup
- Detects backup failure
- Aborts update before making changes
- Exits with code 10

**Error Message:**
```
Oops! I ran into a problem while updating ResearchKit. üòï

What happened:
  I couldn't create a backup of your current ResearchKit.

Why this happened:
  Your computer's disk might be full, or there might be a permissions issue.

The good news:
  I didn't make any changes, so your current ResearchKit is exactly as it was.

How to fix it:
  1. Check if you have space on your computer:
     ‚Ä¢ Open Finder ‚Üí About This Mac ‚Üí Storage
     ‚Ä¢ You need at least 10 MB free for the backup

  2. If you have space, try checking file permissions:
     ‚Ä¢ Run: ls -la ~/.researchkit

  3. If you're sure everything's fine, you can skip the backup:
     ‚Ä¢ Run: ./update.sh --no-backup
     ‚Ä¢ (Not recommended - backups keep you safe!)

```

### Scenario 3: User Customizations Detected

**Input:** `./update.sh` (when templates modified)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Detects modified templates
- Preserves user versions
- Updates only system files
- Shows warning about preserved files

**Warning Message:**
```
Updating your templates...

‚úì Updated CLAUDE-template.md with new features
‚úì Kept your custom question-template.md (I can see you made changes!)
‚úì Updated framework-template.md

I noticed you customized question-template.md, so I kept your version.
If you want to see what's new in the latest version, check your backup at:
  ~/.researchkit.backup.20251025_143000/templates/question-template.md

You can copy any new features you want from there! üìù
```

---

## Idempotency Guarantee

Running `./update.sh` multiple times with the same target version must:
- Detect already up-to-date state
- Exit successfully without changes
- Not create redundant backups
- Not produce errors

**Safe Operations:**
- Check version before proceeding
- Only update files that changed
- Preserve user customizations consistently

---

## Performance Expectations

| Operation | Expected Time | Max Acceptable Time |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Version check | < 1 second | < 2 seconds |
| Backup creation | < 2 seconds | < 5 seconds |
| File updates | < 3 seconds | < 10 seconds |
| Full update | < 5 seconds | < 15 seconds |

**Note:** Times assume local file operations. Network operations (future versions) may be slower.
