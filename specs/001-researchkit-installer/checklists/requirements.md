# Specification Quality Checklist: ResearchKit CLI Installer

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All quality checks passed successfully. The specification is complete, testable, and ready for the next phase.

### Content Quality Assessment
- ✅ No implementation technologies mentioned (languages, frameworks)
- ✅ Focused on user goals: quick setup, validation, and updates
- ✅ Language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections present and complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- ✅ No clarification markers - all requirements are specific
- ✅ All 12 functional requirements are testable with clear outcomes
- ✅ Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, percentages, counts)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details (focus on user experience)
- ✅ Each user story has detailed acceptance scenarios
- ✅ Edge cases cover permissions, failures, configurations
- ✅ Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries
- ✅ Assumptions section documents prerequisites

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- ✅ User stories map to functional requirements through acceptance scenarios
- ✅ Three prioritized user stories cover installation, validation, and updates
- ✅ P1 story represents viable MVP (basic installation)
- ✅ Specification maintains abstraction without implementation bias

## Notes

This specification is well-structured and ready for `/speckit.plan`. Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization with P1 as standalone MVP
- Comprehensive functional requirements covering installation, validation, and updates
- Technology-agnostic success criteria focused on user outcomes
- Well-defined scope boundaries and assumptions
