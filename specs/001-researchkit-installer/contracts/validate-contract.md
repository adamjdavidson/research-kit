```
Checking your ResearchKit installation... üîç

I found a couple of small issues, so I fixed them for you!

‚úì Fixed: File permissions (2 scripts needed execute permission)
‚úì Restored: CLAUDE-template.md from backup

Everything is working now! üéâ

What I fixed:
  ‚Ä¢ Made installer scripts executable
  ‚Ä¢ Restored 1 missing template

You're all set - ResearchKit is ready to use!
```

### Warning Output (Exit Code 0) - Minor Issues (Can't Auto-Fix)

**stdout (default format):**
```
Checking your ResearchKit installation... üîç

Everything works, but I noticed something:

‚ö†Ô∏è Your ResearchKit commands aren't connected to Claude Code yet.

This is okay - the commands are installed, they're just not hooked up.

How to finish the setup (optional):
  1. Make sure Claude Code is installed
  2. I'll connect the commands for you - just run this installer again

Your ResearchKit still works! You can use it with the /rk commands.
```

### Error Output (Exit Code 1) - Critical Issues Can't Auto-Fix

**stdout (default format):**
```
Oops! I found some issues with your ResearchKit installation. üòï

What's wrong:
  ‚úó 3 template files are missing
  ‚úó Some commands couldn't be found

Don't worry - your research data is safe!

How to fix it:
  1. Run the installer again to restore missing files:
     ./install.sh

  2. Or if that doesn't work, do a fresh install:
     ./install.sh --force

### Check 6: File Integrity (Optional - Future Enhancement)

**Purpose:** Verify files haven't been corrupted

**Method:** Compare checksums against `.install_manifest`

**Pass Condition:** All checksums match manifest

**Warning Condition:** User-modified templates (expected)

**Fail Condition:** System files (installer, commands) checksum mismatch

---

## Side Effects

### Read-Only Operations (default)

- Reads files to check existence and permissions
- No modifications to file system
- Outputs validation report to stdout

### Write Operations (with --fix)

- Sets execute permissions on installer scripts: `chmod +x installer/*.sh`
- Attempts to restore missing files from backup (if available)
- Creates missing directories: `mkdir -p <dir>`
- Outputs repair actions to stdout

---

## Pre-conditions

**Required:**
- Installation directory exists and is readable
- User has read permissions on all files to be checked

**Optional (for --fix):**
- User has write permissions to repair issues
- Backup files available (for restoration)

---

## Post-conditions

### On Success (Exit Code 0)

- Validation report generated
- Exit code 0
- No file system modifications (unless --fix used)

### On Warnings (Exit Code 0)

- Validation report shows warnings
- Exit code 0 (installation still functional)
- Suggestions provided for resolution

### On Errors (Exit Code 1)

- Validation report shows errors
- Exit code 1
- Repair suggestions provided
- No file system modifications (unless --fix used)

---

## Error Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Installation Not Found

**Input:** `./validate.sh /nonexistent/path`

**Expected Behavior:**
- Detects missing installation directory
- Outputs clear error message
- Exits with code 2

**Error Message:**
```
Error: ResearchKit installation not found
  Path: /nonexistent/path

This path does not contain a ResearchKit installation.

To install ResearchKit:
  ./install.sh /nonexistent/path
```

### Scenario 2: Partial Installation

**Input:** `./validate.sh` (when some files missing)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Detects missing files
- Lists each missing component
- Provides repair instructions
- Exits with code 1

### Scenario 3: Permission Issues

**Input:** `./validate.sh` (when scripts not executable)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Detects permission issues
- Lists affected files
- Suggests `chmod` commands or `--fix` flag
- Exits with code 1

---

## Idempotency Guarantee

Running `./validate.sh` multiple times must:
- Produce the same result (if no changes between runs)
- Not modify any files (unless --fix used)
- Exit with consistent exit code for same state

---

## Performance Expectations

| Operation | Expected Time | Max Acceptable Time |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Full validation | < 1 second | < 3 seconds |
| JSON output | < 1 second | < 3 seconds |
| Auto-fix mode | < 2 seconds | < 5 seconds |
