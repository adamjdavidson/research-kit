## How AI Can Help

When assisting with this project:

1. **Maintain constitutional compliance**: Check suggestions against research principles above
2. **Cross-reference streams**: Look for connections between different disciplinary perspectives
3. **Prioritize practitioner value**: Focus on actionable insights over purely academic debates
4. **Capture vivid stories**: Help identify concrete, character-driven examples
5. **Evidence traceability**: Ensure all claims can be traced to research sources
